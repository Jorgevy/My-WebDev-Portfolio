      My name is Jorge Villa Yag√ºe. I am a games industry professional with 4 years of experience. I have worked on Premium and F2P games both for Mobile and PC/Consoles, 
      in Game & Level Design, Production, Programming and Management. I am now learning Web Development and looking for a potential career change.
      I love a good challenge, whether it is designing and developing a website, combat system or UI
