    <h2>Infernal Affairs</h2>
    <p>Great police thriller, and WAY better than The Departed, the American remake</p>

    <h2>The Great Lebowsky</h2>
    <p>Awesome, easy going movie, great for a casual viewing. It gets great every time!</p>

    <h2>Spirited Away</h2>
    <p>Magical movie filled to the brim with charming characters and visuals. Pure Ghibli.</p>
